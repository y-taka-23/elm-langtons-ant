# Langton's Ant

This project was proudly generated by ChatGPT, demonstrating its ability to
produce functional and well-structured Elm code.

## Overview

Langton's Ant is a simple, yet fascinating cellular automaton model that exhibits 
emergent behavior. In this project, we have implemented an interactive simulation 
of Langton's Ant in Elm, allowing users to observe and explore the dynamic 
patterns formed by the ant as it traverses the grid according to a set of basic 
rules.
